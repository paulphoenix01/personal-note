Dear Hiring Manager,

I have been studied with Linh Phan (my husband now) since our first day in SJSU, we
both study software engineering major. We take almost every class together, and I
would like to say he is definitely a fast learner, and the smartest person among all my
classmates, with excellent time management skill and problem solving skill.

Besides school, he was also pursuing a lot of Cisco certificates such as CCNA: Security,
CCNP: Routing and Switching, and he is one of the top student at school as well. One
of our professor noticed his potential, and asked if he wanted to be his OpenStack
research assistant, and later recommend him to attend the Verizon and Juniper SDN
Throwdown event. He was the only undergraduate student that join the event among all
other Master and PhD students, and his team won the first place. After that, he been
chosen by Juniper Networks, first as an intern, then extend his offer as part time
employee when he was still at school. With his excellent time management skill, he was able
to handle both the work and study very well. Juniper Networks also reserved him for the
full time position when they give the part time offer.

His role was cloud administrator and network automation, which is similar to software
engineer, as he codes on a daily basis to solve customers' problem and adapt to any
customer requests. Moreover, by working in his last role in Juniper Networks, he offers
solid knowledge of networking and security, certified with Juniper professional and
specialist certificates.

Linh would be an asset to any organization, but he has a particular passion for VISA,
because I keep telling him how much I love my work at VISA and how nice our company
culture is. I strongly recommend him for any position that his skill sets may fit in, and I'd
be happy to answer any questions or discuss my recommendation further. Please feel
free to contact me at Emily.Xie@Visa.com.

Regards,
Emily Xie
